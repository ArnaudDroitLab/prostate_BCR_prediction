## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Importing the data

```{r}

print('Importing your files human')
df = read.table(file = '../data/BF_3_set_omic_clinic_clean.tsv', header = T, sep = '\t', row.names = 'patient')

```

Setting some parameters for the code

```{r}
Y = 'BCR_60' #variable to predict

```

Isolating the column study for further selection by study

```{r}
df_study = as.data.frame(df$study)

```

Reducing the set for first approach of the MLR package

```{r}
#df = df[,1:1000]
```

Changing teh response variable TRUE/FALSE into 1/0

```{r}
if(unique(df[,Y])[1] == 0 || unique(df[,Y])[2] == 1 ){
  print('You TRUE/FALSE value for endogenous variable. I transform it into 1/0')
  df[which(df[,Y] == TRUE),Y] = 1
  df[which(df[,Y] == FALSE),Y] = 0
}
df[,Y] = as.factor(df[,Y])
```

  
## Beginning MLR

Configuring MLR: Stop the verbose mode... defaut TRUE

```{r}
  
configureMlr(show.info=T, show.learner.output = T)
```


Creating first task from the reduced data
```{r}

task = makeClassifTask(data = df,target = "BCR_60", positive = '1')

```

List all method available for feature selection

```{r}

listFilterMethods(desc = TRUE, tasks = FALSE, features = FALSE)

```


Selection of feature by info gain

```{r}

print('Preparing and selectionning features by info gain')
im_feat = generateFilterValuesData(task , method = c("information.gain","chi.squared"))
df_feat = im_feat$data

df_feat_sel = df_feat[which(df_feat$information.gain >= nb_info_gain),]
```
